Originally I wanted to do an app that helped you find haunted places near your location, since we had talked in the interview about how much I love ghosts. Turns out there's not an API of haunted locations. So, I decided to make something simple that demonstrated my ability to communicate with APIs and use state in React. I check the weather every day, so it seemed appropriate.
